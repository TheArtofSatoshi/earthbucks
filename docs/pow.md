- I was looking up GPU mining and the top 3 blockchains on this site ([https://whattomine.com/gpus?cost=0.1&cost_currency=USD&sort=breakeven_asc&nvidia=true&amd=true&filter=all](https://whattomine.com/gpus?cost=0.1&cost_currency=USD&sort=breakeven_asc&nvidia=true&amd=true&filter=all "https://whattomine.com/gpus?cost=0.1&cost_currency=USD&sort=breakeven_asc&nvidia=true&amd=true&filter=all")) are Hoosat, Pyrin, and Karselcoin. They all happen to be recent forks of Kaspa and all use BLAKE3 hash, which is supported by a few miner implementations such as lolminer.
- X16R algorithm
- rumour has it asic may have been developed for x16r, but its a good starting point there has since been X16Rv2 - these were both used by Ravencoin, that now uses something called KAWPOW which I am out of loop on. This might be a little bleeding edge but there is something called Trie-Hashimoto (for real, even though it sounds silly!) https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377828028_Trie-Hashimoto_State_Trie-based_Proof-of-Work_Mining_for_Optimizing_Blockchain_Storage

- I was reading up on whether Blake3 is ASIC resistant and turns out it isnâ€™t. Already FPGAs for BLAKE3 (https://mineshop.eu/colengine-p2-fpga-miner/). Kaspa doesnâ€™t use BLAKE3, instead it sandwiches some matrix multiplications between two SHA-3s, which makes it ASIC resistant. I presume itâ€™s the matrix multiplications that make it ASIC resistant. However I believe you could sandwich them between BLAKE3 as well as proposed here (https://discourse.ironfish.network/t/in-search-of-an-algo-that-is-asic-resistant/39/10).

- Ironfishâ€™s proposed PoW which is inspired by Ethash, requires 5GB to run: https://fips.ironfish.network/fips/fip-3-memory-hard-mining-algorithm
- The problem with matrix multiplication is it turns out itâ€™s pretty easy to put into an ASIC (e.g. https://www.iceriver.io/product/iceriver-ks0-pro/)
