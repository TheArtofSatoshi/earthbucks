- [ ] I was looking up GPU mining and the top 3 blockchains on this site ([https://whattomine.com/gpus?cost=0.1&cost_currency=USD&sort=breakeven_asc&nvidia=true&amd=true&filter=all](https://whattomine.com/gpus?cost=0.1&cost_currency=USD&sort=breakeven_asc&nvidia=true&amd=true&filter=all "https://whattomine.com/gpus?cost=0.1&cost_currency=USD&sort=breakeven_asc&nvidia=true&amd=true&filter=all")) are Hoosat, Pyrin, and Karselcoin. They all happen to be recent forks of Kaspa and all use BLAKE3 hash, which is supported by a few miner implementations such as lolminer.
