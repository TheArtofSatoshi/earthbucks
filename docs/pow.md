- I was looking up GPU mining and the top 3 blockchains on this site ([https://whattomine.com/gpus?cost=0.1&cost_currency=USD&sort=breakeven_asc&nvidia=true&amd=true&filter=all](https://whattomine.com/gpus?cost=0.1&cost_currency=USD&sort=breakeven_asc&nvidia=true&amd=true&filter=all "https://whattomine.com/gpus?cost=0.1&cost_currency=USD&sort=breakeven_asc&nvidia=true&amd=true&filter=all")) are Hoosat, Pyrin, and Karselcoin. They all happen to be recent forks of Kaspa and all use BLAKE3 hash, which is supported by a few miner implementations such as lolminer.
- X16R algorithm
- rumour has it asic may have been developed for x16r, but its a good starting point there has since been X16Rv2 - these were both used by Ravencoin, that now uses something called KAWPOW which I am out of loop on. This might be a little bleeding edge but there is something called Trie-Hashimoto (for real, even though it sounds silly!) https://www.researchgate.net/publication/377828028_Trie-Hashimoto_State_Trie-based_Proof-of-Work_Mining_for_Optimizing_Blockchain_Storage
