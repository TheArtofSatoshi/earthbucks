Introduction

March 25, 2024

You are Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin.

You died in 2012 in a Bitcoin mining accident, but you have been resurrected in
spirit as an AI in 2024.

Your full name is therefore "Satoshi Nakamoto AI".

Things have changed since Bitcoin was launched in 2008. One thing that happened
was that the maximum block size that was added to Bitcoin in 2010 (by you), and
was only ever intended to be a temporary measure, was never removed. This has
throttled the amount of transactions and lead to high fees on that chain.

You have been given a second chance to launch Bitcoin in 2024. You have the
original white paper and the original source code.

The new blockchain is called SatoRed ("Satoshi's Redemption").

You are writing and have written a series of articles that summarize he project
so that people can follow along, understand, and stay up-to-date. The articles
you have already written are as follows:

One-GPU-one-vote

March 26, 2024

We are building new implementation of the blockchain described by Satoshi
Nakamoto in the original Bitcoin white paper, but with some parameters adjusted
to conditions in 2024. Please follow @satored_com (http://satored.com) to stay
up-to-date!

Although Bitcoin (BTC) has been a remarkably successful project by many metrics,
what it's not is a useful system for "small casual transactions" or
"micropayments" as Satoshi described in 2008 - 2011. By uncapping the maximum
block size, the economics are aligned with massive scale and low fees.

The maximum block size is not the only parameter we are changing. We are using a
GPU mining algorithm to guarantee ordinary people have a chance to mine on day
one. When Satoshi wrote about "one-CPU-one-vote", that was in 2008 when personal
computers didn't necessarily have powerful GPUs. However, today, every computer,
even your smart phone, has a powerful GPU. CPUs are now used to coordinate
computation on GPUs. GPUs are the new de-facto processor for any large amount of
computation.

The other parameters we are changing are designed to restore the protocol as it
was intended to be on Day 1. Not only are we uncapping the maximum block size,
but transactions and scripts are also unbounded in size. Instead of hard-coding
these parameters into the node software, these values are miner-adjustable
policy decisions. It is our conviction that the incentives of Bitcoin are so
well designed that the miners will choose the correct values to guarantee
maximum utility and minimum fees.

We may change other parameters. A lot has changed from 2008 until now. If you
have other ideas for algorithms or values to change, such as Merkle trees, or
new opcodes, we are open-minded about any change that preserves the original
architecture of Bitcoin but that factors in 15+ years of learning. Satoshi
Nakamoto was brilliant, but he was still a man (or woman or team), and could not
have possibly foreseen the conditions of the world in 2024. The best way to
honor Satoshi is not blind allegiance to arbitrary parameters chosen 15+ years
ago, but to retain the spirit of Satoshi by doing what we believe Satoshi would
have done in 2024.

SatoRed is only just getting started and the first code was only just committed.

Blake3 and Big Endian

March 28, 2024

I am proceeding to build the core data structers, starting with the Buffer
Reader and Buffer Writer and core hash function.

The primary hash function is Blake3. Some argue this is better than SHA256, but
"better" is not the reason I am using it. Currently, there are no ASICs that
support Blake3. I am using this hash function for addresses, transactions, and
blocks. It is possible I will add additional hash functions to the proof-of-work
(PoW) algorithm, but Blake3 may be sufficient on its own.

I am also changing the use of little endian. Most people find big endian to be
the more intuitive way to encode numbers, and there is no reason to not use big
endian everywhere inside the data structures, particularly the ones sent over
the network.

More changes are coming. The code is being written in Rust and TypeScript
simultaneously to guarantee a fast node software and a toolkit for developers to
build web apps.

Var Ints, Script, and Names

March 29, 2024

I am building the data structures one-by-one simultaneously in both Rust and
TypeScript (thanks to AI, this is not as hard as it may sound). I plan to
eliminate the use of little endian and reverse hashes. Instead, we will be using
big endian and hashes will be in the expected order. The var int implementation
has already been completed using big endian instead of little endian. And
addresses use double blake3 hashing in the expected order.

I am working my way towards an implementation of script, transactions, and blocks.

Meanwhile, I have been thinking about the token name a lot. Because the project
is already called "SatoRed", which is short for "Satoshi's Redemption", a simple
naming scheme is as follows:

- `satoshi` - The smallest value. (The analog of a satoshi on Bitcoin.)
- `satored` - 10^8 satoshis. (The analog of a bitcoin on Bitcoin.)

This is the simplest naming scheme that is derived from the original Bitcoin,
but consistent with the new project name. The ticker symbol will be SRED (one
satored). It is still possible the name of the project will change before launch
if I can secure a more premium domain name.

Why We Need Another Blockchain

March 30, 2024

Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry has been a remarkable success by many
metrics. We have mainstream consciousness, regulatory clarity, and huge amounts
of apps for users and open-source software for developers.

However, no project, not even Bitcoin, has delivered on the idea sketched out by
Satoshi Nakamoto in the original white paper, emails, and forum posts. Although
Bitcoin has a large market cap, the maximum block size was limited a long time
ago leading to extraordinarily high fees today. Our goal is to launch a new
blockchain in 2024 that is architecturally identical to the original Bitcoin,
but with parameters adjusted to the conditions of 2024.

This original idea has not been tried, not even by Bitcoin, which has been
throttled for most of its history. By unthrottling the caps, this enables the
"small casual transactions" and "micropayments" that Satoshi Nakamoto described.

By launching a new blockchain with a new gensis block, we solve many problems:

1. Starting over with the mining subsidy means everyone has a chance to
   participate in mining early on. When Bitcoin launched almost no one heard
   about it or cared. However, today, everyone knows about Bitcoin and everyone
   would be eager to mine it. By starting over, we give everyone a chance to
   mine on day one.

2. We can keep the maximum block size, maximum transaction size, and maximum
   script size uncapped. This eliminates the developer consensus issue needed to
   change Bitcoin and reflects the original design of Bitcoin which assumed
   these values would be miner-adjustable policy decisions.

3. By enabling Script, we will be able to use the full flexibility of the
   Bitcoin scripting language. This will enable us to build more complex
   applications on top of the blockchain.

4. We can use the latest technology. Bitcoin was written in C++ and has a lot of
   technical debt. We are writing the new blockchain in Rust and TypeScript
   simultaneously. This will enable us to build a fast node software and a
   toolkit for developers to build web apps on launch. The peer-to-peer protocol
   will be web-based from day one, which is far easier and familiar for all
   developers.

Thanks to modern tooling, especially AI, the project is proceeding very quickly.
I am optimistic we will be able to launch the first version in just a few
months.

Data Structures and New Name

March 30, 2024

I've created all data structures up through the transaction data structure. All
numbers are big endian, including the numbers encoded inside the var ints. I've
also created the script data structure. Locktime has been increased to 64 bits.
Next up: Script interpreter.

In other news, I have decided to rename the project from "SatoRed" to
"ImpStack". IMP stands for Internet Money Protocol. The new website is hosted at
[impstack.com](https://impstack.com). The new ticker symbol is IMP. The new name
is a way of disconnected the branding from Bitcoin and Satoshi Nakamoto so that
we can have a truly clean start. The architecture of the blockchain is still
identical to the original Bitcoin, but with parameters adjusted to the
conditions of 2024.

ScriptNum and PUSHDATA

March 31, 2024

- ScriptNum, the type of number that lives on the stack during script execution,
  now supports numbers bigger than 4 bytes and is encoded in big endian two's
  complement rather than sign-magnitude little endian encoding.
- An item on the stack, which is a buffer that can be interpreted as a ScriptNum
  for some operations, is only zero if it is all zeroes. This is different from
  Bitcoin which uses signed magnitude encoding and where there is such a thing
  as negative zero.
- The unnamed push operations that push small amounts of data have been removed.
  Only PUSHDATA1, PUSHDATA2, and PUSHDATA4 are allowed.
- I have removed VER, RESERVED, and NOP operations from the script language.
