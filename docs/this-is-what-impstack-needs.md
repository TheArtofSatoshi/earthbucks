go lose 5 dollars there a dollar at a time

buy 5 random shitters

this is what impstack needs

a cheaper and faster pumpfun type ecosystem

even more dopamine

it costs .02 sol to start a coin and the site takes a lot of fees, the dex takes a lot of fees

0 fee everything with lower tx costs and faster wallet ux = boom

if not 0, then like 0.1%
