Hey Ryan, glad to see you working in crypto again. We met briefly once or twice at a CoinGeek conference, I built http://Bit.sv, Open Directory, PoW Market and a few other apps on Money Button.

I'd like to help anyway I can. Here's some unsolicited feedback

* This could totally work!
* The name could be better. Yours, Money Button, Many Button are iconic names. This deserves a great name.
* Radiant is BSV + 2 opcodes, enabling induction proofs. This gives scaleability of UTXOs with ease-of-use of Accounts, definitely worth looking into
* Stable base layer is a big selling feature. Thought this was what Genesis in BSV would be, but things kept changing. Urbit has a great philosophy on how infrastructure code should freeze over time. BIP is a security vector.

If you're not already, collective action is an incredibly powerful lense to view blockchains

* Byzantine Generals, Satoshi solved by making leaderless

* Tragedy of the Commons still exists in BSV, people can load chain with data and everybody has to download it forever. Solution is blockchain not storing data long-term, mostly being timestamp+utxo+scripts, and optionally paying for long-term storage

* Free Rider happens when miners hoard transactions. This was celebrated as a free market victory in BSV, but through collective action lense it breaks the network. Solution is paying miners for routing and not relying on volunteering of #5.1 in whitepaper

Let me know if there's anything you're looking for help on, or I'd be happy to be an early app dev on the platform.
Cheers, Brad
