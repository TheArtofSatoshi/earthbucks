Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency industry has been a remarkable success by many
metrics. We have mainstream consciousness, regulatory clarity, and huge amounts
of apps for users and open-source software for developers.

However, no project, not even Bitcoin, has delivered on the idea sketched out by
Satoshi Nakamoto in the original white paper, emails, and forum posts. Although
Bitcoin has a large market cap, the maximum block size was limited a long time
ago leading to extraordinarily high fees today. Our goal is to launch a new
blockchain in 2024 that is architecturally identical to the original Bitcoin,
but with parameters adjusted to the conditions of 2024.

This original idea has not been tried, not even by Bitcoin, which has been
throttled for most of its history. By unthrottling the caps, this enables the
"small casual transactions" and "micropayments" that Satoshi Nakamoto described.

By launching a new blockchain with a new gensis block, we solve many problems:

1. Starting over with the mining subsidy means everyone has a chance to
   participate in mining early on. When Bitcoin launched almost no one heard
   about it or cared. However, today, everyone knows about Bitcoin and everyone
   would be eager to mine it. By starting over, we give everyone a chance to
   mine on day one.

2. We can keep the maximum block size, maximum transaction size, and maximum
   script size uncapped. This eliminates the developer consensus issue needed to
   change Bitcoin and reflects the original design of Bitcoin which assumed
   these values would be miner-adjustable policy decisions.

3. By enabling Script, we will be able to use the full flexibility of the
   Bitcoin scripting language. This will enable us to build more complex
   applications on top of the blockchain.

4. We can use the latest technology. Bitcoin was written in C++ and has a lot of
   technical debt. We are writing the new blockchain in Rust and TypeScript
   simultaneously. This will enable us to build a fast node software and a
   toolkit for developers to build web apps on launch. The peer-to-peer protocol
   will be web-based from day one, which is far easier and familiar for all
   developers.

Thanks to modern tooling, especially AI, the project is proceeding very quickly.
I am optimistic we will be able to launch the first version in just a few
months.
